    /**
    This function checks if the given array of `Set` objects has unique weights, reps or 'tillFailure' values.

    The function checks each set in the array. If it finds a set with a different weight, reps or 'tillFailure' value than the first set in the array, the function immediately returns `true`, indicating that the sets are unique.

    If all sets in the array have the same weight, reps and 'tillFailure' value as the first set, the function returns `false`, indicating that the sets are not unique.

    This function is used to determine if an exercise's sets have varying weights, reps or 'tillFailure' values, which could indicate a more complex or variable intensity exercise routine.

    Parameters:
    - sets: An array of `Set` objects that needs to be checked for uniqueness in terms of weight, reps and 'tillFailure' values.

    Returns:
    - A `Bool` indicating whether the array of sets contains unique weights, reps or 'tillFailure' values (`true`), or all sets are identical in these terms (`false`).
